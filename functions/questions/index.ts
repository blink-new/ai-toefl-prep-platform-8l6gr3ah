      passage: `The Industrial Revolution, which began in Britain in the late 18th century, marked a fundamental shift in human civilization. This period saw the transition from manual labor and handicrafts to mechanized production and factory systems. The invention of the steam engine by James Watt in 1769 was particularly significant, as it provided a reliable source of power that was not dependent on natural forces like wind or water.

The revolution had profound effects on society. Urban centers grew rapidly as people moved from rural areas to work in factories. This urbanization led to significant changes in family structures, social relationships, and living conditions. While the Industrial Revolution brought about increased productivity and economic growth, it also created new social problems, including poor working conditions, child labor, and environmental pollution.

The textile industry was among the first to be transformed by industrialization. The invention of machines like the spinning jenny and the power loom revolutionized cloth production, making it faster and more efficient than traditional hand-weaving methods. This transformation not only changed how textiles were produced but also had far-reaching effects on international trade and economic relationships between nations.`,
      question: 'According to the passage, what was particularly significant about James Watt\'s steam engine?',
      options: [
        'It was the first machine invented during the Industrial Revolution',
        'It provided power that was independent of natural forces',
        'It was primarily used in the textile industry',
        'It solved the problems of poor working conditions'
      ],
      correctAnswer: 'It provided power that was independent of natural forces',
      explanation: 'The passage states that the steam engine "provided a reliable source of power that was not dependent on natural forces like wind or water," making this option correct.',

      passage: `Climate change represents one of the most pressing challenges of our time. The scientific consensus indicates that human activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels, have significantly increased atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases. These gases trap heat in the Earth's atmosphere, leading to global warming and associated climate changes.

The effects of climate change are already visible worldwide. Rising sea levels threaten coastal communities, while changing precipitation patterns affect agriculture and water resources. Extreme weather events, including hurricanes, droughts, and heatwaves, are becoming more frequent and intense. These changes pose significant risks to human health, economic stability, and ecosystem integrity.

Addressing climate change requires coordinated global action. The Paris Agreement, signed in 2015, represents an important step toward international cooperation on climate issues. However, meeting the agreement's goals will require substantial changes in energy systems, transportation, and industrial processes. Many experts argue that technological innovation, combined with policy changes and individual actions, will be essential for mitigating climate change impacts.`,
      question: 'What does the passage suggest about the Paris Agreement?',
      options: [
        'It has successfully solved the climate change problem',
        'It represents progress but requires significant implementation efforts',
        'It focuses primarily on technological innovation',
        'It was the first international climate agreement'
      ],
      correctAnswer: 'It represents progress but requires significant implementation efforts',
      explanation: 'The passage describes the Paris Agreement as "an important step" but emphasizes that "meeting the agreement\'s goals will require substantial changes," indicating progress with significant work still needed.',

      passage: `The human brain's capacity for language acquisition has fascinated researchers for decades. Children demonstrate a remarkable ability to learn language naturally, often mastering complex grammatical structures without formal instruction. This phenomenon has led linguists to propose that humans possess an innate language acquisition device, a theoretical mechanism that facilitates language learning.

Critical period hypothesis suggests that there is an optimal window for language acquisition, typically occurring before puberty. During this period, the brain exhibits high plasticity, making it easier to acquire new languages. After this critical period, language learning becomes more challenging, though not impossible. This explains why children who are exposed to multiple languages early in life often become fluent speakers of all languages they encounter.

Recent neuroscientific research has provided insights into the brain mechanisms underlying language processing. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have identified specific brain regions associated with different aspects of language, including Broca's area for speech production and Wernicke's area for language comprehension. These findings support the idea that language processing involves specialized neural networks.`,
      question: 'According to the critical period hypothesis mentioned in the passage, when is language acquisition most effective?',
      options: [
        'After formal education begins',
        'During the teenage years',
        'Before puberty',
        'In early adulthood'
      ],
      correctAnswer: 'Before puberty',
      explanation: 'The passage explicitly states that the critical period for language acquisition "typically occurs before puberty" when "the brain exhibits high plasticity."',
